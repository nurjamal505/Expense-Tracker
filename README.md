# Documentation for Expense Tracker Program

## Project Title: Expense Tracker

---

## Overview
The Expense Tracker program was developed as a university project by our team consisting of **Nurjamal**, **Jasmin**, and **Nazima**. The primary goal of the application is to help users record, manage, and track their expenses effectively. The project followed a structured development process, focusing on collaboration, planning, and iterative design to create a reliable and user-friendly tool.

## Development Process

### 1. Brainstorming and Planning
The project began with intensive brainstorming sessions. During this phase, we discussed user needs, key features, and the technical structure of the application. A prototype was drafted, laying the foundation for subsequent development.

### 2. Prototype Testing
A prototype was built and tested for functionality, usability, and design aesthetics. Feedback from this stage was instrumental in refining the application's structure and features.

### 3. Implementation
The development process was divided into three major components:

#### **Interface (View)**
- Designed by **Jasmin** using Scene Builder to ensure a visually appealing and intuitive experience.

#### **Database (Model)**
- Managed by **Nurjamal**, who designed and implemented a secure and efficient database for expense data storage.

#### **Controller**
- Developed by **Nazima**, who created the logic to connect the user interface with the database, ensuring seamless operation.

We worked long hours, including weekends, overcoming various challenges related to integration and performance optimization.

## Challenges
The project was not without challenges. The most significant obstacles included:

- Aligning the user interface with backend functionality.
- Debugging integration issues between the controller and the database.
- Managing time effectively to meet deadlines.

However, through teamwork and determination, we overcame these hurdles.
